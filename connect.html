								During the training we utilize the church-approved book entitled: “Real-Life Discipleship Training Manual” by Jim Putman, et al.<br><br>
								This is a step-by-step game plan to making effective disciples. It is designed to equip small groups to multiply followers of Christ. It is a twelve-week course that helps assess spiritual maturity, understand what it means to be an intentional leader, and learn how Jesus used relationships purposefully.<br><br>
								Participants have shared that they have discovered so much information for personal use and growth and feel they are enjoyed a more personal relationship with Jesus, as an added benefit of completing the training.<br><br>
								The class is usually kept between 1-4 people, so an appropriate amount of time can be given to each of the participants.

				        		Last year we enjoyed a wonderful year of serving our Lord by growing closer to Him through scripture. We grew our knowledge of the bible and engaged in conversation that helped us explore ways to deepen our understanding of His word. Our emphasis is always on application.<br><br>
								We took a beautiful walk thru the Psalms, discovering the history, reason and uses of them in our lives. We chose some to break down to see the application in our lives. We also walked thru the parables and how they apply to our lives today.<br><br>
								We practiced bible basics by playing Bible Feud, listened to Christian music and most importantly enjoyed the fellowship of each group member and grew our relationships with each other. This small group encourages each other to help others, and ultimately learn what it means to be ONE part of a greater whole<br><br>
								ONE is a relaxed atmosphere, where scripture and the importance of reading the bible is the focus.
								For our service, we focused on The Promise House by making donations and coordinated an evening of fellowship, by preparing and delivering 15 meals, ready to be frozen to help the families in need.<br><br>
								We also organized a bulletin board called Put-N-Take to help members and families with items they could donate to those in need, as well as making it easier for those needing help to ask, by placing requests on the same board.<br><br>
								Lastly, we organized a donation board for monetary and gift card donations for AVAC and the Promise House, which was a huge success.

The meals have been provided through volunteers with the mealtrain service <a href="https://www.mealtrain.com/" target="_blank">Mealtrain</a>, cash donations, and gift card donations. We are currently studying "taming our tongues" (how God wants us to use our words) as well as working on scripture memorization. This group was also a part of the Thanksgiving Family meal, roller skating, and bowling. We are averaging 15 kids per week right now but it varies throughout the year based on sports and other activities. We have many regulars and continue to get new members each year. Bible Bunch is under the direction of Leah Irvine.

We average ten kids weekly. We play games in the gym and unwind from their day. A favorite is "W-I-S-E" which is "Poopdeck", a classic from Cam's days at NHPC. After burning off some energy the students are provided a drink and a snack. We then go upstairs to the Youth Group room for a time of worship and study. We are currently studying Ephesians and our identity in Christ as well as working on how to build and maintain relationships, a challenge for this age range. We are beginning to focus on ways to serve others too. We end the study with a time of prayer and then play games or do crafts related to the topic/season. We hosted a Family Thanksgiving meal again this year. We also had a bowling event. Leadership of this group is Leah Irvine and Rick Harbaugh.

				      			The Community Kidz youth connect group meets at the Hayden Center in Sheldon Park. In 2024, we met directly with the youth in that community quarterly and averaged 10-12 students ranging from pre-k to 6th grade. On months we did not meet directly, we stayed connected with the students through sending cards, which was the suggestion of a parent.<br><br>
								The group meets from 1-2:30 pm. During meetings we play a game or do a craft, share a meal, and provide a Bible lesson. In 2024, the lesson delivered was prompted by answering a students question; ‘Why do you believe in God?’. The leader delivering the lesson used their testimony to answer that question supported by scripture.<br><br>
								In 2025, group leadership has decided to increase the ministry to meeting every other month and will continue mailings to stay connected to the students. This year’s lessons will surround the major stories of the Bible starting with creation. The leader delivering the lesson will choose which Bible story they want to teach. The 2025 program year will also include splitting the group for lesson time into pre-k to 1st grade in one group and 2nd - 6th grade in another.
