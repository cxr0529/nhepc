					<p>As a family church that does community outreach, to make disciples of youth in the community through the simplified ministry structure of "Worship, Connect, Serve".</p>
					<p>- Worship of God is a way of life engaged on a regular basis. Worship services are to be blended in terms of worship music style.</p>
					<p>- Connecting together is to be done through connect groups of which there are two types:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Adult Connect Groups - as defined as 6-12 people who gather outside the time of worship to build strong relationships with Jesus, each other, and the youth of the community and by extension, their families at the Allegheny Family Network.</li>
						<li>Youth Connect Groups - as defined under the current structure of a Bible Brunch Connect Group, and a junior and senior high connect group. These groups cary in size based on reaching as many of the youth in the community as possible.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>- Serving together encompasses both involvement in the life of the church utilizing spiritual gifts and moving beyond the walls to meet the needs and build relationships with youth and by extension, their families at the Allegheny Family Network.</p>
