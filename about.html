					</ol>
					<p>- Serving together encompasses both involvement in the life of the church utilizing spiritual gifts and moving beyond the walls to meet the needs and build relationships with youth and by extension, their families at the Allegheny Family Network.</p>

					<center><h4>What is the Reformed Presbyterian Church?</h4></center>
					<p>The reformed movement started in Scotland and grew from a desire to see change or “reform” in the Roman Catholic Church in Europe. When the printing press was invented, Martin Luther was able to read the Bible. Luther discovered inconsistencies in what the church was doing. He noticed these practices were not Biblical and he wanted these things to end. Some of the examples of inconsistencies Luther found included praying to the saints, praying to Mary, praying indulgences for a loved one to reduce time in purgatory, and the belief in purgatory.</p>
					<p>In response, Luther proposed 95 questions (theses) to the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church by nailing them to the door of the church in Wittenberg, Germany. The goal was to start a conversation with the leaders of the church. Instead, the Roman Catholic Church excommunicated Luther. The questions Luther proposed and the ideas he presented were the starting point for a new church movement that became known as “the reformation.” During the reformation, the Lutheran church was established by Luther.</p>
					<p>In Geneva, Switzerland, John Calvin formalized and expanded on Luther’s ideas. John Calvin wrote the “Institutes of the Christian Religion.” This became the first publication of books to explain the church’s reformed ways of thinking and doing things. The combined writings of Luther and Calvin became known as “reformed theology.” As members of the Presbyterian Church, we subscribe to this way of thinking.</p>
					<p>John Knox was from Scotland also; he studied reformed theology under John Calvin. The result was he took what he learned back to his native country. Back in Scotland, Parliament abolished the Roman Catholic Church from its country and established a “presbyterian form of church government and leadership.”</p>
					<p>Soon people started to settle in the new world. When this happened, the Presbyterian Church made its way to America. The first states the Presbyterians settled in was New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In Philadelphia, the first presbytery was established in 1709. The presbyterian church was modeled after the first century church established by the Apostles of Jesus.</p>
					<p>The presbyterian church is run and managed by elders. This is the translation of the Greek word, “presbuteros.” As the presbyterian church began to take shape, one elder would take on more of the teaching and instruction roles. This person would become known as “the teaching elder.” This is what we now know as the “minister” or the “pastor” today. Other leaders took on more leadership, government, spiritual discernment, and discipline. They became known as “ruling elders.” In the presbyterian church, both the elders and the minister are elected by the congregation for the positions they serve.</p>

					<center><h4>Important documents in the EPC</h4></center>
					<span><strong>The Westminster Confession of Faith:</strong> This is a reformed statement of faith written in 1646 in the Westminster Assembly as part of the Westminster Standards to be a confession of the Church of England. It became and remained the subordinate standard of teaching in the church of Scotland and has been influential within Presbyterian Churches Worldwide. This document speaks to worship, teaching, government, and discipline inside the church.</span><br><br>
					<span><strong>The Book of Order:</strong> This is the constitution of the presbyterian church. Included in this large document is the Book of Church Government, The Book of Church Discipline, and The Book of Church Worship. The original book of order was written in 1981 and has been updated since then when needed.</span><br><br>
					<span><strong>The Essentials of our Faith:</strong> These are the 7 principal beliefs that are a foundation to our faith</span><br><br>
					<span><strong>The Apostles' Creed:</strong> This is first mentioned in a letter from the Synod of Milan dated 390 AD. In the Apostle’s Creed, there are statements that are made about the Trinity and what they have done for us across history. Every Christian Church should hold to these beliefs.</span><br><br>
