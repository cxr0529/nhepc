					<center><h4>Mission Statement</h4></center>
					<p>The Natrona Heights Presbyterian Church, an Evangelical Presbyterian Church, is a body of communicants in Christ. We exist in order to be the instruments of God's work; To minister to the needs of those in our church body and the community; To provide refuge and sanctuary where Christians can assemble and commune; To provide an opportunity for the hearing and knowing of the Word for Christian nurture; To observe the sacraments and to obey the command of discipleship in spreading the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ in our local and world mission.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12" id="reformTradition">
					<center><h4>Reformed Tradition</h4></center>
					<p>Our Evangelical Presbyterian church comes out of the Reformed Tradition and as such have beliefs that grew out of the Protestant Reformation from the Catholic Church.  These fundamental beliefs are the basic pillars of our faith and essential to our Christian belief and practice. One of these doctrines that refers to the Bible is known as Sola Scriptura. This phrase is Latin with "Sola" meaning alone or only and "Scriptura" referring to the scriptures of the Bible. So together, Sola Scriptura means that the Bible alone is the only inspired, perfect, sufficient and authoritative Word of God. It is the only source for Christian doctrine. The origin of the Bible is God.  It is a historical book that is backed by archeology, and a prophetic book that has lived up to all of its claims. The Bible is God's letter to humanity collected into 66 books written by 40 divinely inspired writers over a period of over 1,600 years. The claim of divine inspiration may seem dramatic (or unrealistic to some), but a careful and honest study of the biblical scriptures will show them to be true. Powerfully, the Bible validates its divine authorship through fulfilled prophecies.  An astonishing 668 prophecies have been fulfilled and none have ever been proven false. God decided to use prophecy as His primary test of divine authorship, and an honest study of biblical prophecy will compellingly show the supernatural origin of the Bible.</p>

					<center><h4>Statement of Faith</h4></center>
					<p>The Natrona Heights Presbyterian Church (EPC) is a body of communicants in Christ. We exist in order to be the instrument of God's work; to minister to the needs of those in our church body and the community; to provide a refuge and sanctuary where Christians can assemble and commune; to provide an opportunity for the hearing and knowing of the word for Christian nurture; to observe the sacraments and to obey the command of discipleship in spreading the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ in our local and world mission. Final Authority for Matters of Belief and Conduct: The statement of faith does not exhaust the extent of our beliefs. The Bible itself, as the inspired and infallible Word of God that speaks with final authority concerning truth, morality, and the proper conduct of mankind, is the sole and final source of all that we believe. For purposes of the Natrona Heights Presbyterian Church’s faith, doctrine, practice, policy, and discipline, Rev. Cam Malcolm and the NHPC Board of Session are the Natrona Heights Presbyterian Church’s final interpretive authority on the Bible’s meaning and application.</p>

					<center><h4>The Five Solas</h4></center>
					<p>The “Five Solas” emerged during the Protestant Reformation as Latin phrases meant to summarize the Reformers’ fundamental theological beliefs, as distinct from those of the Roman Catholic church. The Latin word “sola” means “alone” or “only,” and the “Five Solas,” taken together, articulated the basic pillars of faith the Protestant Reformers believed were essential to Christian belief and practice.</p>
					<p>Deriving from the Reformed Tradition, the Presbyterian denomination is grounded in these “Five Solas”, which find their expression in the Presbyterian Church (USA)’s Book of Confessions.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>The Person and Work of Jesus Christ: “Solus Christus” – by Christ Alone</strong>
							<p>“Solus Christus” is the Reformed teaching that Jesus Christ is one with God, that by His death and bodily resurrection He is the unique and only mediator between God and humans, and that there is salvation in no other.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>The Authority of Scripture: “Sola Scriptura” – by Scripture Alone</strong>
							<p>“Sola Scriptura” is the Reformed teaching that the Bible is the only inspired, perfect, sufficient and authoritative word of God and the only source for Christian doctrine.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Salvation: “Sola Gratia” – by Grace Alone</strong>
							<p>“Sola Gratia” is the Reformed teaching that salvation comes by divine grace only, and apart from any human merit or achievement.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>“Sola Fide” – by Faith Alone</strong>
							<p>“Sola Fide” implies that our justification (i.e. being declared just by God) is received by faith only, without reliance on “good works.” Taken together, these two doctrines recognize that our salvation from death to life is entirely dependent on the grace of God, who imputes to the believer the righteousness of Christ. This then is a “free” gift received by the believer simply through faith, and not merited by any work on the part of the believer. Implied in these two concepts is the need for redemption from the universality of sin, which is understood as the fundamental and universal human affliction which separates us from God. It is this affliction which necessitates our justification, for apart from forgiveness in Christ, our sinful condition necessarily leads to our destruction. Salvation by faith in God’s wondrous grace is thus understood to bring redemption from this fate and to eternal life with God.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Everything for God’s Glory: “Soli Deo Gloria” – Glory to God Alone</strong>
							<p>This final “Sola” represents the culmination of our faith—that everything is done for God’s glory alone. Implicit in this doctrine is the idea that any thought, belief, or activity that is not in keeping with the will of God as expressed in Scripture is to be denied. God is understood as represented by the Trinity—a manifestation of God in three distinct persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We are created by the Father through the Son through whom we have been redeemed. We are then drawn into a holy, Trinitarian communion by the Holy Spirit, empowering us to be fruitful as we experience abundant and eternal life. Reformed faith tells us not only that Jesus Christ is our Savior, but that he is our present Lord, our future Judge, and our coming King. Thus, our life in Christ is a disciplined life in which our wills and sinful inclinations must be conformed to His example and teaching as we witness it in Scripture, so that everything we think and do is done in reverent submission and honor to the glory of God.</p>
